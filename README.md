<h1><i>Spike</i></h1>
<p>A basic text editor, written in C.</p>
 
<p>
    Developed using <a href="http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo" target="_blank">snaptoken's kilo tutorial</a>, 
    which is based on Salvatore Sanfilippo's (aka <a href="https://github.com/antirez" target="_blank">antirez</a>)
    <a href="https://github.com/antirez/kilo" target="_blank">kilo</a> project.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>I did this project for fun, but I realized that this was a great opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Refresh my mind on C/C++ syntax and topics, such as pointers, memory management/allocation, and user defined data types (typedef)</li>
    <li>Brush up on basic Unix/Linux commands</li>   
    <li>Create something that I would use on a regular basis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p><b><i>Spike</i></b> has many features such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Ctrl-S</code> --> Save</li>
    <li><code>Ctrl-Q</code> --> Quit</li>   
    <li><code>Ctrl-F</code> --> Search</li>
</ul>
